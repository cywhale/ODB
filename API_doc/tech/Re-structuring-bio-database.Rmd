# **Re-structuring bio-database**

## *Mutating a new bio-database on PostgreSQL* 

The bio-database of ODB had been constructed since 2009 and completely set-up on Microsoft SQL Server since 2015. The data curation is basically done by a Microsoft C# program. These protocols of data curation was documented in 圖輯. For developing an open cross-platform framework for web APIs of bio-database, first, we mutated a bio-database on PostgreSQL, i.e., exported from SQL Server, and then re-imported to a new database by using PostgreSQL.

  &check; API is a set of interfacing specifications for machine-to-machine communications. Here we focus on web API, i.e., data transport upon HTTP request/response structure. Most popular web API protocol is REST (Representational State Transfer), and increasingly used, GraphQL API. Commonly used data formats are JSON and XML.

  &check; API can provide a secure way to access bio-database (internal APIs, Fig. 1.1) with authority management. On the other hand, API can also provide open-access methods for public information compiled from bio-database (public APIs).

Why not just use original Microsoft SQL Server as backend database for developing APIs of bio-database?

  &check; SQL Server is a commercial software with annual license fees.

  &check; SQL Server is suited for the Microsoft Server based framework, but not for an open cross-platform framework.
